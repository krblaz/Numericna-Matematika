# Homework 1
For this homework I implemented SOR iteration for sparse matrices. Tests and examples are in a form of a Jupyter notebook `sor.ipynb`
# Homework 2
For the first part I implemented probability function of normal distribution with adaptive trapezoidal rule. To run the program run it with `python main.py \<p\> [eps = 1e-10]` where `p` is the input and `eps` is desired error rate. To run tests, run `python normal_test.py`

For the second part I've tried to calculate the area of a hypotrochoid. The solution and explanation is contained in a Jupyter notebook `hypotrochoid_area.ipynb`.

# Homework 3
For this homework I calculated the length of a implicit curve. The solution and explanation is contained in a Jupyter notebook `implicit_surface_curve.ipynb`.
