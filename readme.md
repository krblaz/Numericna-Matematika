# Homework 1
For this homework I implemented SOR iteration for sparse matrices. Tests and examples are in a form of Jupyter notebook `sor.ipynb`
# Homework 2

For the first part I implemented probability function of normal distribution with adaptive trapezoidal rule. To run the program run it with `python main.py \<p\> [eps = 1e-10]` where `p` is the input and `eps` is desired error rate. To run tests, run `python normal_test.py`

For the second part I've implemented my solution together with the explanation of my approach in Jupyter notebook `hypotrochoid_area.ipynb`.
